                    When developing a cross-platform application, there are
                    roads that can be hit – building it as a Progressive Web App
                    or as a React Native App. Most of the time, people get
                    confused when they start researching what approach is better
                    for their business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result of the research’s tendency to lead to further
                    speculation, it’s not surprising that some readers are left
                    scratching their heads. However, this isn’t how things
                    should go.We’re talking about complicated processes, but
                    they can all be simplified quite easily. Only when
                    completely understood, an informed decision based on your
                    company’s requirements can be made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to help you get out of the “land of confusion”,
                    let’s break down the basics of both frameworks and see how
                    they react (pun intended) with the features you are
                    developing.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Rudiments of React Native</h2>
                  <p>
                    React Native apps are written in Java-like codes and are
                    able to run on different mobile devices, regardless of the
                    OS platform. This is possible due to the cross-platform
                    utilization framework which is in its nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They live on the user’s smartphone and are entered by
                    touching its icon on the Home screen. These apps can use all
                    of the device features including the camera, contact list,
                    GPS and others, can provide notifications, have offline
                    capabilities as well as gestures incorporated.
                  </p>
                  <p>The most important benefits of this framework are:</p>
                  <div>
                    <ul className={styles.lista}>
                      <li>Reliable and fast apps with great performance</li>
                      <li>Amazing UX</li>
                      <li>Immense security</li>
                      <li>Native design and reusable code</li>
                      <li>Full device integration</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <h2>Where Are React Natives Implemented</h2>
                  <p>
                    It’s difficult to identify a single use case since it is
                    used to construct a variety of applications, including
                    prominent social networking apps like Facebook, Instagram,
                    Pinterest, and so on (e.g., Skype, Discord, Tencent QQ,
                    etc).
                  </p>
                  <h2>The ABC’s of PWA</h2>
                  <p>
                    On the flip side,{" "}
                    <a href="https://www.digitalstrategyone.com/progressive-web-apps-are-taking-over/">
                      Progressive Web Apps
                    </a>{" "}
                    are websites that imitate a Native App behavior and create
                    an app-like experience. With possibilities of working with
                    web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS and HTML, any
                    website can turn into an app that feels just like a Native
                    one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its core, PWAs provide 4 key technologies that set them
                    apart from competition:
                  </p>
                  <div>
                    <ul className={styles.lista}>
                      <li>
                        Application shell architecture which provides fast
                        loading time
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Transport Layer Security that bring data and privacy
                        integrity
                      </li>
                      <li>Immense security</li>
                      <li>Offline support</li>
                      <li>Exact same code for both iOS and Android</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    App-like features like push notifications, offline
                    availability, and the ability to install PWAs are all
                    provided by service workers and web app manifests at their
                    core. It’s steel hard security allows browser to server
                    encryption since it’s based on HTTPS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This cost-effective framework brings another amazing benefit
                    – relying on SEO, since in a nutshell, they are a website.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Why Stick With PWAs</h2>
                  <p>
                    This framework is ideally suited for websites that want to
                    deliver more engaging, connectivity-independent experiences,
                    or simply for websites that want to reach a broader
                    audience, because of their web-based nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the e-commerce business, where features like push
                    notifications and offline availability are critical to
                    increasing conversion rates and cultivating a more loyal
                    client base, PWAs are already experiencing widespread
                    acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Goods and The Bads</h2>
                  <p>
                    Both of these approaches to cross-platform app development
                    have their specific advantages. Some businesses may take a
                    less expensive approach, but in some cases that might
                    negatively affect their earnings in the long run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are many different pros and cons to both approaches,
                    but we will present to you some of the most important ones.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Development Costs</h2>
                  <p>
                    Due to the high degree of complexity required, React Native
                    applications tend to be costly to build. Simpler projects
                    may cost upwards of $15.000, you can publish your app to
                    both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, lowering
                    overall development expenses without compromising user
                    experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A basic PWA project should cost between $1000 and $10.000,
                    but the costs can drastically vary. If you choose the
                    headless design (which is more flexible and scalable than
                    the conventional architecture), your PWA development
                    expenses would skyrocket owing to the increased degree of
                    technical skill needed.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Accessibility and UX</h2>
                  <p>
                    Native apps get you access to a greater range of native
                    APIs, considering its nature. Consequently, it is feasible
                    to get systemic and low-level access to the device’s
                    hardware, such as access to NFC (Near Field Communication),
                    the contact list, or other features, in order to enhance the
                    user experience.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Security</h2>
                  <p>
                    A React Native app is inherently more secure and less
                    susceptible to vulnerabilities because of the increased
                    degree of interaction with the device in use. During the
                    development process, different ways may be used to increase
                    the security of a project, such as
                  </p>
                  <div>
                    <ul className={styles.lista}>
                      <li>
                        SSL Pinning is used to protect app-to-server
                        communications.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Biometric/face authentication may be used in conjunction
                        with keychain/sensitive-information storage.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Added levels of self-defense can be accomplished using
                        Jscrambler.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    In other cases, most of the security work is done by the
                    browser since PWAs exist in the browser environment and use
                    the browser for most of their capabilities. Unlike a
                    conventional website, the PWA’s essential component—the
                    service worker—only uses HTTPS, ensuring that all
                    communication between the client and server is always
                    secured.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Launch Time and Installation</h2>
                  <p>
                    Progressive Web Apps don’t need to be searched, downloaded
                    and installed. There is no approval time from either Google
                    Play Store or Apple’s App Store. Not even possible
                    rejections due to plagiarism or copyright infringement,
                    allowing a much faster launching process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anyone, with or without an internet connection, can access
                    them instantly, leaving no time for the customer to second
                    guess their decision on the App Store.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <h2>SEO Discoverability</h2>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, Progressive Web Apps act like
                    websites, which means additional SEO work can be done
                    around, allowing a more successful, organic promotional
                    strategy. A cost-effective SEO strategy, such as{" "}

                    get new customers by boosting your App Store search results’
                    visibility.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    So, what is the right framework for your business? Are you
                    looking for a lightweight solution, with an effortless
                    updating and installation process with multiple features and
                    functionalities? Or your company is in need of a full device
                    integration with reusable codes and guaranteed security?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the time being, it is safe to say that both of these
                    frameworks will continue to be equally relevant. Prior to
                    choosing the app development strategy, the most important
                    step is clearly defining your company objectives in terms of
                    your target audience and intended app features.
