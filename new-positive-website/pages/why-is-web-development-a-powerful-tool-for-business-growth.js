                    Web presence is essential for any business to be successful
                    today. Not only is a great web presence important for new
                    businesses, but it’s necessary for established businesses as
                    well. While social media is a valuable addition to the
                    company’s online game, a website is a true gem. There is no
                    good digital marketing if the site isn’t accurate,
                    informative, responsive, and easy to navigate. Observing the
                    market allows you to keep your site useful and unique. It
                    will also ensure business growth through suitable web
                    solutions. Managing to create a user-centric experience will
                    help any business stand out and beat the competition. Here
                    is why web development is the key factor in keeping your
                    business successful and lucrative

                  <h2>The Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
                  <p>
                    We’re slowly approaching the point in time when everyone
                    will be able to control all of the devices with just one
                    click. This sort of change needs to be accounted for when it
                    comes to designing an efficient website that can easily be
                    accessed by any device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While some companies are not ready to embrace these changes,
                    others are already adapting. Even though the internet of
                    things is still in its primitive phase, it won’t be long
                    before it reaches its full potential. Because of this, it’s
                    better to start adapting on time.

                  <h2>Machine learning (ML)</h2>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning is introducing a new web development era
                    that is making it easier to complete various tasks via
                    smartphones, PCs, and other devices. There is less and less
                    need for additional programming. This enables apps to gather
                    and analyze valuable information and use that to suggest
                    adequate solutions. Due to previous experience, smart
                    devices can make intelligent and well-calculated decisions.

                  <h2>The ABC’s of PWA</h2>
                  <p>
                    ML is possible thanks to the data it collects. The higher
                    the quality of the data is, the more reliable will the
                    predictions made by the program be. If the model is simpler,
                    it will be easier for the machine to go through the learning
                    process. Once the{" "}

                    is selected, desired results are easily achieved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This data is easily available, especially due to the rise of
                    smartphone usage and the apps that come with them. The
                    biggest challenge web developers have to face is going
                    through tons of data and selecting the appropriate ones.
                    Having in mind the fact that ML is being used more and more,
                    it’s useful to keep up with all of the changes and learn how
                    to operate ML to keep a business growing.

                  <h2>Accelerated mobile pages (AMP)</h2>
                  <p>
                    AMP is a new approach to developing and designing fast
                    smartphone web pages. It allows web developers to design
                    pages that can be easily used on mobile phones with a fast
                    loading speed. The goal is to create a flawless and
                    fast-loading web page for smartphones because it leads to an
                    easy content replacement, lower bounce rate as well as
                    better ad visibility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    People prefer to use phones to use search engines these
                    days. A fast and easy working website that can be used on
                    mobile phones is for that very reason an amazing idea.
                    Business growth is ensured once a company can reach a wider
                    audience. AMP doesn’t just reach people – it also improves
                    the user experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When using their phones to access websites, the last thing
                    people want is to have trouble loading pages and waiting a
                    long time for the page to load up. To make an impactful
                    difference through web design, companies need to make sure
                    their website runs smoothly and is easy to navigate on all
                    devices.

                  <h2>Augmented reality</h2>
                  <p>
                    Virtual reality and augmented reality have changed the
                    entertainment industry in the last couple of years. One
                    simple instance of AR is the world-famous application –
                    Pokémon Go. We have all witnessed the impact it had on
                    society. In the future, similar applications are expected to
                    gain similar popularity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Revolution of the app development industry has already
                    begun thanks to AR technologies. We can only expect the same
                    for the web industry too. This field is yet to be explored,
                    but, certainly, many changes are ahead of us. For example,
                    content marketing as we know it will soon be reshaped.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The user experience will only keep getting better due to the
                    AR technology. Some of the most interesting industries to be
                    affected by these changes are healthcare, engineering, and
                    real estate. Almost any business could benefit from AR,
                    which is why this will be an important addition to any
                    website.

                  <h2>Keeping track of the progress</h2>
                  <p>
                    Every business decision will affect the company in some way.
                    The important thing for every business owner is to keep
                    track of how a certain decision affects the business.
                    Approaching the data analytically is the key to making
                    better decisions in the future and staying relevant in the
                    market.

                    are some of the features that indicate how successful a

                    Mistakes aren’t the worst thing in the world when it comes
                    to running a business. However, ignoring bad results can be
                    fatal for a company. That is why good web development is a
                    valuable asset. It can help companies notice the faults,
                    change them, and improve their results.

                  <p>
                    It may seem that websites are no longer relevant in digital
                    marketing. However, having a well-designed website can do
                    wonders for a business. The field of digital marketing is
                    evolving all the time, and combining the older technologies
                    with new ideas will make any website and business expand
                    quickly and efficiently!
